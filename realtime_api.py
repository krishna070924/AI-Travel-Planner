"""Small realtime_api compatibility shim.

Provides `get_travel_insights_realtime(...)` so imports in `app.py` succeed
and the code can call a single entrypoint for realtime travel insights.

Behavior:
- If MISTRAL_API_KEY is set and `get_mistral_insights` is available, uses that.
- Otherwise falls back to `travel_planner.get_travel_recommendations`.
